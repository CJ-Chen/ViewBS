regions.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

or for whole genome-wide.

=head1 Required arguments

=over 8

=item B<-help> | B<-h>

 - Prints the help message and exists.

=item B<--verbose>
   
=item B<sample [required]>

 - Provide the sample information. [Format: methlationfile,samplename] 
   It is possible to specify more than one sample pair by using the options 
   --sample more than once. The methylation information can also be read from
   a TEXT file. Instead of giving an explicit sample information pairs, 
   you need to write file: followed by the name of the TEXT file.

=item B<minDepth [optional]>

 - Minimum read depth for calculating methylation level. [default: 5]

=item B<maxDepth [optional]>

 - Maximum read depth for calculating methylation level. [default: 10000]

=item B<binMethLev [optional]>

 - Bin size to calculate the distribution of methylation level. [default: 0.1]

=item B<outdir [optional]>

 - Provide the output directory. [default: ./]

=item B<prefix [optional]>

 - Provide prefix for the output file. [default: MethLevDist]

=item B<height [optional]>

 - Height of PDF figure. Unit is cm. [default: 10]

=item B<width [optional]>

 - Width of PDF figure. Unit is cm. [default: 10]
