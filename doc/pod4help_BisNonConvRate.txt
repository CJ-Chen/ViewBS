=head1 NAME

ViewBS BisNonConvRate - Estimate non-conversion rate of BS-seq data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

ViewBS BisNonConvRate --chrom <ChrC> --sample <meth,sample_name> [--sample <meth,sample_name> .......]
--prefix <prefix for output> --outdir <output folder> 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ViewBS BisNonConvRate will estimate non-conversion rate of BS-seq data based on the unmethlated
Chromsome, like chloroplast genome in plant or PhiX genome. 

=head1 Required arguments

=over 8

=item B<-help> | B<-h>

 - Prints the help message and exists.

=item B<--verbose>
   

=item B<sample [required]>

 - Provide the sample information. [Format: methlationfile,samplename] 
   It is possible to specify more than one sample pair by using the options 
   --sample more than once. The methylation information can also be read from
   a TEXT file. Instead of giving an explicit sample information pairs, 
   you need to write "file:" followed by the name of the TEXT file.
   See details at: https://github.com/readbio/ViewBS

=item B<chrom [required]>

 - Chromosome ID that the users want to use to estimate non-conversion rate. 

=item B<minDepth [optional]>

 - Minimum read depth for calculating methylation level. [default: 5]

=item B<context [optional]>

 - Sequence context for calculating non-conversion rate. It is possible to specify 
   more than one sample pair by using the option --context more than once. [default: CXX]
   CXX means non-conversion rate will be calculated based on all the 3 sequence context. 
   
=item B<maxDepth [optional]>

 - Maximum read depth for calculating methylation level. [default: 10000]

=item B<outdir [optional]>

 - Provide the output directory. [default: ./]

=item B<prefix [optional]>

 - Provide prefix for the output file. [default: GlobalMethLev]

=item B<height [optional]>

 - Height of PDF figure. Unit is cm. [default: 10]

=item B<width [optional]>

 - Width of PDF figure. Unit is cm. [default: 10]
