=item B<Subcommands:>

=item B<MethCoverage>

 - Generate coverage report for BS-seq data

=item B<BisNonConvRate>

 - Generate bisulfite non-conversion rate for BS-seq data using the
   provided chromosome (usually chloroplast for plants). 

=item B<GlobalMethLev>
 
 - Generate global (bulk) methylation level report for BS-seq data

=item B<MethLevDist>

 - Generate distribution of methylation level for different sequence context (CG, 
   CHG and CHH) for BS-seq data

=item B<MethGeno>

 - Generate the methylation information across each chromosome and plot the 
   information.

=item B<MethOverRegion>
  
 - Generate the methylation information across the regions provided and generate 
   meta-plot. The regions can be genes, transposable elements, etc. 

=item B<MethHeatmap>

 - Generate heat map and violin-boxplot for selected regions.

=item B<MethOneRegion>

 - Visualize DNA methylation for a given regions.
